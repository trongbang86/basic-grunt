## What is this?
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is great.

[Bower](http://bower.io) is great.

**And how we can use them to set up a small front-end project.**

`Basic Grunt` is a sample project which uses Grunt and Bower to manage dependencies and tasks.

Following are some of the highlights of this project:
1. Separated configurations for different tasks such as wiredep, grunt connect
2. shared constants across configuration
3. Angular and Bootstrap are used
4. Custom bootstrap theme is used [Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com)
5. Wiredep is used to inject dependencies such as angular and bootstrap
6. Wiredep is used to inject project specific javascripts and css
7. The project can be imported into Eclipse
