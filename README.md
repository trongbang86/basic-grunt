## What is this?
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is great.

[Bower](http://bower.io) is great.

**And how we can use them to set up a small front-end project.**

`Basic Grunt` is a sample project which uses Grunt and Bower to manage dependencies and tasks.

Following are some of the highlights of this project:
- Separated configurations for different tasks such as wiredep, grunt connect
- shared constants across configuration
- Angular and Bootstrap are used
- Custom bootstrap theme is used [Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com)
- Wiredep is used to inject project dependencies such as angular and bootstrap
- Wiredep is used to inject project specific javascripts and css files
- The project can be imported into Eclipse
- Split tasks into smaller files instead of defining in Gruntfile.js
- Font Awesome
- grunt-usemin is used to minimise bower dependencies' files such as javascript and css files

A sample AngularJS project is also implemented with the following highlights:
- Top menu with dropdowns
- Controllers
- A set of different UI components such as tables, forms
- Single Page Application
- Angular Route is used
- A configuration file to share data across our web app
