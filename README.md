## What is this?
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) is great.

[Bower](http://bower.io) is great.

**And how we can use them to set up a small front-end project.**

`Basic Grunt` is a sample project which uses Grunt and Bower to manage dependencies and tasks.

Following are some of the highlights of this project:
- Separated configurations for different tasks such as wiredep, grunt connect 
- shared constants across configuration 
- Angular and Bootstrap are used 
- Custom bootstrap theme is used [Cerulean](http://bootswatch.com) 
- Wiredep is used to inject dependencies such as angular and bootstrap 
- Wiredep is used to inject project specific javascripts and css 
- The project can be imported into Eclipse
